# Stencil Notes

## SVG Drafting Notes

- Each different sized stencil will need to be re-drafted and de-featured to accomodate minimum feature resolution of stenciling
- Minimum aperature size: 1/8" (Body paint stencil vs. spray paint stencil?)
- Minimum bridge size: 1/8"
- Keep bridges on a separate layer. Combine bridge layer and art layer as last step to preserve the art in case it needs to be resized

## Laser Settings

- Using Trotec laser at Maker's Edge in Waco, TX
- Use 600 dpi or scaling issues can occur due to inkscape 96dpi workspace.
